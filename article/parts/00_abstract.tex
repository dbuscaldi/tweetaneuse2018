We present our contribution to the DEFT 2018 shared task, with three entries based on different methods to perform topic classification and polarity detection for tweets in French, to which we added a voting system.
Our first entry is based on lexicons (for words and emojis), character n-grams and a classifier implemented with a support vector machine (\textit{SVM}), while the other two are endogenous methods based on character-level feature extraction: first a long short-memory recurrent neural network (\textit{Bi-LSTM}) feeding a classifier implementing a multi-layer perceptron, and second a model based on frequent closed character sequences with a {SVM}.
The \textit{Bi-LSTM} system gave the best results by far.
It ranked first on task 1, a binary theme classification task, and third on task 2, a four-class polarity classification task.
This result is very encouraging as this method has very few priors, is completely endogenous, and does not require any specific preprocessing.
